/*

  Namespace is an organizational method that helps to clearly show where a method is coming from.
  Namespaces are generally a great idea in C++ because they help us scale things. C++ has no notion of scoped modules,
  so all of the code you write in any file could potentially conflict with other classes/functions/etc. 
  Namespaces help to differentiate pieces of your code.
 
  The convention In this skeleton is to name the namespace to match the name of the subdirectory where it lives.
  So in this case, the namespace is called "standalone" because this method lives within the "standalone" subdirectory.
  If there is another "hello" function used for another example, the compiler will know the difference between the two:
 
  standalone::hello
       
       VS

  potato::hello

*/
namespace standalone {

	// hello, custom sync method tied to module.cpp
	// method's logic lives in hello.cpp
	NAN_METHOD(hello);

}
