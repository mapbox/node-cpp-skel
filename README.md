A skeleton for binding C++ libraries to Node.js using [Nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan). This is a small, helper repository that generates a Javascript constructor called `HelloWorld`. `HelloWorld` has a number of methods to demonstrate different ways to use Nan for building particular types of functionality (i.e. asynchronous functions).

Nan is used in many C++ => Node.js port projects, such as [node-mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik), [node-osrm](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/node-osrm), and [node-osmium](https://github.com/osmcode/node-osmium). More examples of how to port C++ libraries to node can be found at [nodejs.org/api/addons.html](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html). See https://nodesource.com/blog/c-add-ons-for-nodejs-v4/ for a detailed summary of the origins of Nan.

**Why port C++ to Node.js?**. That's a great question! C++ is a high performance language that allows you to execute operations without clogging up the event loop. Node.js is single-threaded, which blocks execution. Even in highly optimized javascript code it may be impossible to improve performance. Passing heavy operations into C++ and subsequently into C++ workers can greatly improve the overall runtime of the code.

# What's in the box? :package:

The skeleton prepares a C++ port to Node.js and provides the following for quick development:

* **Tests**: created with [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) in the `test/` directory. Travis CI file is prepared to build and test your project on every push.
* **Documentation**: uses [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/) to generate API documentation from JSDOC comments in the `.cpp` files. Docs are located in `API.md`.
* **Build system**: [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) generates binaries with the proper system architecture flags
* **Publishing**: Structured as a node module with a `package.json` that can be deployed to NPM's registry.

# Installation

This repository itself can be cloned and edited to your needs.

```
git clone git@github.com:mapbox/node-cpp-skel.git
cd node-cpp-skel

# Build binaries. This looks to see if there were changes in the C++ code. This does not reinstall deps.
make

# Run tests
make test

# Cleans your current builds and removes potential cache
make clean

# Cleans everything, including the things you download from the network in order to compile (ex: npm packages).
# This is useful if you want to nuke everything and start from scratch.
# For example, it's super useful for making sure everything works for Travis, production, someone else's machine, etc
make disclean
```

Note: by default the build errors on compiler warnings. To disable this do:

```
WERROR=false make
```

To build from scratch

# Code coverage

Code coverage is critical for knowing how well your tests actually test all your code. To see code coverage you can view current results online at [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mapbox/node-cpp-skel/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mapbox/node-cpp-skel) or you can build in a customized way and display coverage locally like:

```
make coverage
```

For more details about what `make coverage` is doing under the hood see https://github.com/mapbox/cpp#code-coverage


# Xcode

![npm-test scheme in Xcode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52399/16448893/4967a454-3df4-11e6-8bb5-701fe46174ef.png)

If you're developing on macOS and have Xcode installed, you can also type `make xcode` to generate and open an Xcode project. In the dropdown, choose `npm test` to run the npm tests. You can also add more targets by adding the appropriate lines in `Makefile`, and rerunning `make xcode`. If you are modifying `binding.gyp`, e.g. by adding more source files, make sure to rerun `make xcode` so that Xcode knows about the new source files.

# Usage

### Standalone sync function
```javascript
var module = require('./path/to/lib/index.js');
var check = module.hello();

console.log(check); // => world
```

### Object
```javascript
var module = require('./path/to/lib/index.js');
var HW = new module.HelloWorld();
var hi = HW.wave();

console.log(hi); // => howdy world!
```

# Add Custom Code
`node-cpp-skel` was designed to make adding custom code simple and scalable, to form to whatever use-case you may need. Here's how!

- Create a dir in `./src` to hold your custom code. See `./src/standalone` as an example.
- Add your new method or class to `./src/module.cpp`
- Add your new file-to-be-compiled to the list of target sources in `./binding.gyp`

# Publishing Binaries

It's a good idea to publish pre-built binaries of your module if you want others to be able to install it properly on their own systems, which can very likely not have a compiler like `gcc` or `clang`. Node-pre-gyp does a lot of the heavy lifting for us (like detecting which system you are building on and deploying to s3) but you'll need a few things configured to get started.

1. In the `package.json`, update the `"binary"` field to the appropriate s3 bucket `host`.
1. If you plan on publishing binaries via Travis-CI, [setup your AWS security credentials in the `.travis.yml`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp#travis-automation) - this gives the travis environment the proper access to the bucket named above.

**Publishing on Travis CI**

This project includes a `script/publish.sh` command that builds binaries and publishes them to s3. This script checks your commit message for either `[publish binary]` or `[republish binary]` in order to begin publishing. This allows you to publish binaries according to the version specified in your `package.json` like this:

```
git commit -m 'releasing 0.1.0 [publish binary]'
```

Republishing a binary overrides the current version and must be specified with `[republish binary]`.

**Adding new operating systems and node versions**

The `.travis.yml` file uses the `matrix` to set up each individual job, which specifies the operating system, node version, and other environment variables for running the scripts. To add more operating systems and node versions to the binaries you publish, add another job to the matrix like this:

```yaml
- os: {operating system}
  env: NODE="{your node version}" TARGET="Release"
  install: *setup
  script: *test
  after_script: *publish
```
